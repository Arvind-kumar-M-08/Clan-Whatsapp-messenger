# Devhack - Automation is the best, just take rest!

## Abstract 
With technological boost all around, automation is the need of the hour to perform menial tasks like sending bulk messages and emails to specific contacts through social media(Whatsapp) for creating awareness regarding events from various domains like social, technological, political, cultural, etc increasing cognizance among people. Our project aims at resolving this common issue faced by organizations day in and day out. Given an excel sheet with mobile numbers listed and a message, our bot will send whatsapp messages to those numbers with the message irrespective of whether the contact number is saved in the sender's phone.

## How to run the code : 

1. Download the executable file from the github repo.
2. Make sure your default browser is Google Chrome and whatsapp web has been logged on to atleast once with "Stay signed in" checked.
3. Double-click on the .exe file 
4. Give two inputs : 
   1. A .csv file containing column of phone numbers to whom the whatsapp message is to be sent. 
   2. A.txt file containing the message to be sent.
5. Sit back and observe the bot sending messages in bulk to all the required phone numbers.
